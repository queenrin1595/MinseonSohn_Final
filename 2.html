<P>Make Sure Students Have Access to Devices and the Internet
Because some students may not have access to a computer, laptop or mobile device to access e-learning activities at home, schools may have to deploy them. But funding is a challenge, and schools may not have enough to establish a one-to-one program for all grade levels, Ishmael says. Plus, even though 98 percent of U.S. public schools are connected to high-speed internet broadband, that’s not necessarily the case for students at home. “The most recent data shows that about 14 percent of our current K–12 population doesn’t have connectivity at home; that’s about 7 million students,” Ishmael says. “Even if they are able to take devices home, they might not be able to use them.” Some districts have started putting mobile Wi-Fi hotspots on school buses and parking them in low-income neighborhoods, Krueger says. If libraries or other educational institutions are open, districts can work with them to provide loaner hotspots, he says. In 2018, policymakers also introduced a bill to extend the FCC’s E-rate program for equipping Wi-Fi on school buses. And now, with the current COVID-19 outbreak, several broadband providers are offering service deals to help equip households without internet access. Districts must still ensure they have enough bandwidth to support the increased use of systems that staff and students will be relying on for e-learning.</P>
